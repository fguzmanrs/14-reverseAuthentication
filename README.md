# Reverse Engineered Authentication

Reverse engineered the starter code provided and created a tutorial for the code.

## User Story

AS A developer
I WANT a walk-through of the codebase
SO THAT I can use it as a starting point for a new project

Business Context
When joining a new team, you will be expected to inspect a lot of code that you have never seen before. Rather than having a team member explain every line for you, you will dissect the code by yourself, saving any questions for a member of your team.

## Reverse engineering activity:

* In the Develop folder, there is starter code for a project. 
* Inspecting the code to get an understanding of each file's responsibility. 
* Write a tutorial explaining every file and its purpose. If one file is dependant on other files, be sure to let the user know.
* At the end add instructions for how you could now add changes to this project.

## Reverse engineering file availability

* A link to a document with instructions on how and what each section of code is doing in Develop/ is provided upon request.
